Async SSE notify offload + coalescing tests for the keep-workflows copy.

Mirror of keep-event-handler's tests/test_sse_notify_async.py (cross-repo
rule), adjusted to the workflows package layout. The workflows copy was fully
synchronous before SC-04; these tests prove it now offloads + coalesces like
event-handler.
